Unofficial update for HousekeeperAssistanceCat mod by Edge Crescent. While using the same assets, background logic for cleaning tasks is fully reworked. Their ability to reproduce is disabled, so you can only tame or buy them (you can edit the mod's LifeStages.xml to re-enable it).

This mod adds a new kind of animal - Housekeeper Cat. When Obedience is trained, they are able to do cleaning tasks. They are also eligible for hauling training. As a bonus, they can produce small amounts of quality wool.

Unofficial HardCore SK adaptation mod by ArpoMo6 with the addition of color generation (white, black, gray, red and brown).

Неофициальное обновление мода HousekeeperAssistanceCat mod (автор Edge Crescent). Здесь должно быть описание, связанное с переделкой логики уборки, но качественно перевести я это не сумел. Возможность размножения выключена ориг. автором, поэтому котиков можно получить только купив или приручив их (размножение можно включить в папке с модом в файле LifeStages.xml).

Этот мод добавляет новый вид животных – Housekeeper Cat. После обучения преданности, они получают возможность уборки. Они также могут быть обучены переноске (имейте в виду, что переноска имеет более высокий приоритет, чем уборка) и производят небольшое количество качественной шерсти в качестве маленького бонуса.

Неофициальная адаптация модификации под сборку HardCore SK (автор ArpoMo6) с добавлением генерации окраски (белый, чёрный, серый, рыжий и бурый).

    <name>Oni of the Rim: Lite</name>
    <description>The mysterious horned and feathered humanoid found on some rim worlds, Oni are often sought out by Glitterworlds for their beauty as a sort of exotic pet. Worse still some are kept as livestock for their feathers, pelts and horns, all having practical and decorative uses. Oni live in temperate areas and rarely employ clothing due to the uncomfortable sensation on their feathered bodies. Due to this, they are highly vulnerable to being set on fire.

In comparison of base human stats, Oni are more attuned with nature and are more physically suited to a wider set of environments, and do not care about being nude or sleeping on the floor. They are more adaptable in unarmed combat, using their razor sharp nails to claw away at their target, and able to use their horn for impaling. All natural attacks can cause bleeding. In social fights, their damage is restrained so they don't cut off a limb or cause excessive hemorrhaging.
With them being more focused on the physical and nature side, they have little trouble with grasping the scientific concepts and and precisions of construction and crafting. When building or fixing machinery, they can seemingly be a little bit clumsy, more likely to make small critical mistakes leading to failure.
At least with crafting, they simply take little bit longer to not make such mistakes, although they have completely no issues with tailoring or artistic work.

They got a tiny bit more difficulties in making safe meals, due to them perceiving food and ingredients a little different to us humans. They are more than happy casually eat things raw, including insect meat.

This version of the mod does not have most of the Oni related items or tech, except for the horn related body parts and some Oni dust: Blessings.

Hate how your stockpile is overflowing of useless thing or just the fact it just a sore eye. I have a simply solutions by using my "Simply Storage"
a compact way to storage all of your useless Junk that you don't need into my Storage contains, no more of that over size stockpile take away space 
that you can use for more important things. Now you can have a compack base, Call 1-800-Simply-Storage.

Important: Due to Deep Storage and Architect Sense conflict, You have to disable "Put all storage units here" in LWM's Deep Storage mod options and restart the game, opening Deep Storage options will break it again putting things inside and outside subcategories until next restart.

    <description>Description
What if we were to finally discover dinosaur DNA sequences, despite being incomplete, and fill the blanks with various genome sequences spliced from left and right, with a little bit of imagination to help guide us?

Wonder no more! A group of Glitterworld scientists, having long abandoned the ideals to terraform the rimworlds with a purpose, went out of their ways to answer just that. With the mechanoids long having gone haywire with their terraforming projects, the dinosaurs created in labs were slowly introduced into fauna that should otherwise have resembled a 21st Century Earth, with little to no care as to their compatibility with existing wildlife and the forsaken rimworld colonists, the latter of which nobody seems to care about anyway.

Dinosaurs
32 new species of dinosaurs are introduced through this mod, all of which spawn in various different biomes:
- Ankylosaurus,
- Brachiosaurus,
- Brontosaurus,
- Utahraptor,
- Gallimimus,
- Iguanodon,
- Pachycephalosaurus,
- Parasaur,
- Spinosaurus,
- Stegosaurus,
- Triceratops,
- Tyrannosaurus Rex,
- Velociraptor,
- Carnotaurus,
- Protoceratops,
- Yutyrannus,
- Corythosaurus,
- Diplodocus,
- Dryosaurus,
- Baryonyx,
- Dilophosaurus,
- Compsognathus,
- Therizinosaurus,
- Minmi,
- Gigantoraptor,
- Dakotaraptor,
- Deinocheirus,
- Pteranodon,
- Stygimoloch,
- Quetzalcoatlus,
- Magyarosaurus,
- Allosaurus.

    <name>Frontline - Bunkers</name>
    <description>
This mod provides an additional way to fortify your Frontline with new bunker structures:
General:
- You need to do research in order to get these structures.
- The bunkerroof is not a real roof as of terms of game mechanics, you still will have to build a room like in vanilla 

Structures:
Bunker wall:
Slope walls are the foundation of your bunker. Needs A LOT of resources to build but can withstand even the hardest bombardement. Bombs harm it more than ordinary bullets. Takes a lot of time to be set up.

Bunker embrasure:
Waist high walls grant your pawns a spot to use their own arms in combat and also provides some cover (70%) . Also in contrast to the ordinary sanbags, enemys can't climp over these structures. Bombs harm it more than ordinary bullets. Takes a lot of time to be set up.

Bunker door:
A heavy door granting passage inside the bunker. It can only be opened manually. Holds of fire for a long time, but costs a lot of resources. Bombs harm it more than ordinary bullets. Takes a lot of time to be set up.

Bunkerroof:
A semi transparent roofing. Comes in the sizes 5x5 and 3x3. [i][notification: More sizes MIGHT come on demand, maybe start a discussion here.][/i]  Does not hold a roof by itself, it needs surroundings. Takes a lot of time to be set up.

Feel free to leave a comment and please report back any occuring bugs. And finally: Have Fun.

    <description>Description
Thanks to the wonders of today's technology, the small group of scientists that was previously known for bringing the Megatherium-
Uh, I mean, the Megasloth back to life, was able to make the Megafauna Project a reality! 
This time around, they were able to recreate 38 different species of animals that used to inhabit planet Earth thousands to millions years ago. 
...Was that a wise move? Who cares! Now we all can feast our eyes on those glorious beasts as they will slowly inevitably turn all the ecosystems we know upside-down!

Features
38 new species of animals, all able to spawn naturally in different biomes:
- Arthropleura,
- Doedicurus,
- Daeodon,
- Gigantopithecus,
- Paraceratherium,
- Titanis,
- Titanoboa,
- Woolly Mammoth,
- Elasmotherium,
- Smilodon,
- Chalicotherium,
- Megaloceros,
- Procoptodon,
- Megalania,
- Gomphotaria,
- Diprotodon,
- Short-faced Bear,
- Dinocrocuta,
- Sivatherium,
- Andrewsarchus,
- Dinornis,
- Macrauchenia,
- Quinkana,
- Deinotherium,
- Aurochs,
- Megalochelys,
- Palaeeudyptes,
- Josephoartigasia,
- Gigantophis,
- Meganeura,
- Zygolophodon,
- Platybelodon,
- Purussaurus,
- Uintatherium,
- Pulmonoscorpius,
- Dinopithecus,
- Castoroides,
- Enhydriodon.

These animals are quite rare, and should be a good challenge to either tame or slay. 
A lot of them can also be used as pack animals for a caravan (with paraceratherium being your new best caravan buddy!).
Wooly mammoth, elasmotherium, and josephoartigasia are shearable, and arthropleura, titanis, titanoboa, megalania, dinornis, quinkana, megalochelys, palaeeudyptes, gigantophis, meganeura, and purussaurus do lay eggs. Sivatherium, macrauchenia, aurochs cows, and uintatherium are milkable - sivatherium's milk is very nutritious and quite valuable!

    Rabbie The MoonRabbit Race

    As you can see in the night sky, the moon exists in the Rimworld. And there are residents in the moon.
    Rabbbies are races that migrate from moon to moon beyond the universe.
    With a brilliant brain and close to Glitterworlds technology, they are prospering all universe by building a giant arcology, the moon city.

     +Rabbie is smart and smart, and stands out in intellectual activities like research + 
     -But they're mentally unstable, so they have higher mentalbreak threshhold - 
     -and are more severely affected by Psychic waves - 
     +Due to the long history of war, combat skills have been developed, allowing fast shooting and more accuracy + 
     +They have also developed the ability to safely treat and operate on injured people and to synth drugs + 
     -However, because of their weak body structure, they are very vulnerable to melee combat. - 
     -they have lower carrying capacity and the lower speed of mining - 

      Planetarium  

    Long ago, the ancestors of Rabbie who were migrating were captured by Transcendent Planet and genetically manipulated throughout the Spaceship, they got excellent intellectual abilities, but in the absence of a special substance called Planetarium, they became lunatic.

    The only places where Rabbitish empires can migrate are rare planets that can harvest planetarium. It is mostly because of the Planetarium that the soldiers of the empire and the Dept.Energysupply staffs come down to the planet and cause friction with Planet's natives or civilizations.
    Rabbies are also enjoying this material, commonly called  'Spice' . A refined Planetarium can also be consumed, but it will give you a richer scent when you drink it with tea or cocktails and keep your more mental clearer.
    Rabbie, who has consumed planetarium for a long time, is said to have the ability to see a blurry but short future and have an amazing shooting ability.

    You can also replenish Planetarium, at least in part, by ingesting Braincrystal-the nervous system in which planetarium is crystallized-which can be found when you open the head of a deceased Rabbie. It's a scary story.
    Wherever Rabbies are, saving planetarium will be a top priority. Otherwise, you may have a terrible ending.

      New faction, Rabbitish Empire  
    The Rabbitish empire migrates to the moons of several planets for a long time to build a city, but because of its long distance, it cuts off from the empires of the previous universe and elects a new empress of the universe.
    The Rabbitish empire's policy on the planet depends on Empress's thinking and the development of the moon city.
    Rabbitish Soldiers and scientists on the planet are in duty of the enormous energy and planetarium needs of the moon city and its citizens.
    They may be exclusive or hostile at first, but they will usually be indifferent if they feel not threatening to their work or if you are cooperative.

    Make hostile impressions on them, or do not let your forces feel threats to them.
    If your settlement is both, be careful! The Rabbitish Empire is a country with a lot of war experience. They have been at war with the inhabitants of various planets, and victory against many of civilizations. If they think you threaten the empire, you'll be attacked with advanced technology.
    do not recommend shooting against them like line-infantry. because it's the beneficial combat of the Rabbitish Empire. They will be relatively weak before melee.
    Their army consists of a field army of Rabbie citizens and a regular army descending in space with power armor.

      Two Storytellers  
    Cele Jackrabbit - Cele Jackrabbit is a senior officer in the Rabbitish Empire. Drink spice tea together in her flagship, and carefully listen to the War of the Rabbitish Empire and the history of blood (most events are replaced by raids, increasing in difficulty and preparing for war. )

    Luna Jackrabbit - (Coming soon) Cele's sister, Luna, is Scientist of Dept.energysupply. She is working to cure the mental problems that Rabbie race has brought down from now on. she say quiet and clearly, but you will be listens to increasingly confusing and scary stories.

      etc  
     Various Pawn Customizing 
     Various ability-enhancing clothing 
     Over 120 backstories 

    Rabbie race mod allows you to customize your pawn by combining different pretty outfits and colors.
    Give your pawns a unique personality by mixing different face, ear shapes and hairstyles.
    All Rabbie apparel also fit perfectly with vanilla outfits, with proper in-game balancing.

    Rabbie race mod seeks to enrich the enjoyment of vanilla play.
    Rabbie's equipment is expensive and requires a long time to craft, and you will still need vanilla weapons and equipment to survive.
    Also, other clothing and equipment mods can be used naturally.

    <description>
    A race mod for bloodthirsty foxgirls in RimWorld.
    
    Revia are near-humans with vulpine traits. Feared in the sector of the galaxy that they exist in for their warlike natures, it is said that Revia accept only one absolute law in their society: the strong live and prosper, and the weak serve the strong in whatever way they are able.
    Their society worships bloodshed in the name of a certain deity that sits upon a throne of bleached skulls, and will stop at nothing to slake his thirst.
    
    Features:
    - A foxgirl race with guaranteed Bloodlust trait.
    - A mechanic which allows them to grow extra tails as they offer more sacrifices to their blood god. They become stronger in melee, take less damage, and have more hitpoints as they gain more tails. Caps out at 9.
    - A faction of their kind which acts hostile, and whose raiders will never retreat. Blood is blood, no matter whose side spills it!
    - Some weapons that fit with their bloodthirsty nature. Their weapons have lower armor penetration than standard ones, however they inflict significantly greater bleed damage.
    - No racial clothes limitations! No hair limitations! These foxgirls are very much humanlike. Pick and choose your favourite cosmetic mods and roll with it!
    
    Suggested mods to go with this one:
    - Some form of hat-hiding mod. Hats for humans clash badly with fox ears.
    - A Rimworld of Magic

    <description>These are flying caravans, meant to load people and cargo and bring it somewhere else -- potentially a very long distance, and back again. These act like drop pods, but are not one use -- when you bring it back home you choose where to land and disembark.

Great for hauling cargo, trading with factions, assaulting points of interest on your world map, and so much more. Acts as both a caravan and a drop pod.

A few additional role-specific short range transport shuttles (or SRTS) so you really can fly across the whole world and back again. All ships require their own research project, and they're not cheap. All passengers heal, rest, and eat while on board all transport shuttles, but some shuttles are easier than others to rest in.

Conflicts
- Multiplayer mod: You will not be able to actually load anything into the ship. It won't work. Sorry.

    <description>Ever wanted to fly through Rimworld with style and practicality? Well helicopters are here to bring you just that, helicopters have always been the king when it comes to aeronautical utility, the ability for helicopters to land without a runway is incredibly useful, especially when secure spaces are of a premium due to pesky raiders trying to steal your tables, it also allows you to launch attack operations without needing an entire airfield to land on, which is great for retaliation and retaking your stolen tables.

    <description>This mod adds a special storage that can contain a large number of items, as well as ports and access points "connected" to the storage through which pawns can place and pick up items. This storage consumes energy for each stored stack of items. In the lack of energy, items can still be removed, but it will not be possible to place new ones.\n\nThe mod is based on Project Ramfactory Revived, but most of the code concerning the DSU has been redesigned.\nBut in any case, let's say a huge thank you to those guys for their hard work and amazing mod!</description>

    <name>Celsius</name>
    <description>Celsius adds realistic simulation of thermodynamics to the game.

Main features:

- Temperature is simulated for every map cell (as opposed to vanilla's room-level abstraction). It is hot near fires and geyzers. Various building materials have different isolation properties based on their real-world counterparts. Mountains provide more stable temperature (which you can adjust) as do large bodies of water.

- Water can freeze, and ice can melt. Rivers, seas and marshes may turn into icy plains in the winter and melt again in the summer. Setting up fires on glaciers can uncover water or ground underneath. Be careful, so that your pawns don't drown in deep water. 

- Flammable things may spontaneously ignite when it gets extremely hot. Different materials have different ignition temperatures, and it can affect buildings, manufactured items, plants and more.

- Tweaks to various related features, such as wind and wetness affecting pawns' comfortable temperature and snow melting faster under rain.

Celsius opens up many new challenges and ways to play RimWorld. Forgo houses and warm colonists at campfires, melt ice sheets or unleash deadly firestorms on your enemies!

Supported mods:
- Alpha Animals
- Insulation
- Primitive Workbenches
- Vanilla Furniture Extended: base mod, Architect, Medical, Security
- Windows

All DLCs are supported. Mod authors can provide patches on their side or submit PRs in Github.

FAQ:

- Can I install the mod in an existing save? Can I remove it?

Celsius can be installed in an ongoing game. It may take a few seasons for all the temperatures to adjust.  Note that Celsius deeply changes temperature-related gameplay in RimWorld, so you will almost certainly need to adapt both your base and your play style. Removal mid-game is also theoretically possible but untested. 

- How does it affect performance?

I worked hard to optimize the mod, and it shouldn't seriously slow down your game. In my tests on a rather ordinary laptop I haven't noticed any impact at all. Old machines and multiple or very big maps may have a different experience, but it shouldn't brick your computer.

- Any known incompatibilities?

Heat Map, Proxy Heat and similar mods are not needed, because Celsius does everything these mods do (and much more). Other mods that also change temperature-related mechanics will also probably conflict.

Some modded vents, coolers and the like may experience issues or be unbalanced. There have been reported problems with Vanilla Expanded reactors and Android Tiers cores overheating.

In general, mods that add walls, doors and building stuff may need patches. Celsius will do its best to adapt to them, but can't magically tell what thermal properties these things should have.

- How do I report issues or share feedback?

The best option is to use Github: https://github.com/GarwelGarwel/Celsius/issues

You may also leave comments on the Steam page. If you are reporting a bug, make sure to enable Debug Logging in the settings and attach the Player.log file.

--- Original Description ---
Overview
V1.1

Adds pharmaceuticals and new food items.

Drug Chemical Mixer

Autonomously produce precursor chemicals. The mixer has "input" and "output" hoppers to control resources and product. There is a selector for the chemical to produce, control production and set stock limits.

Drug Cabinet

Can be used to store items (acts as a shelf). Additionally adds some cleanliness whilst boosting production of drug labs.

Disinfectant Stand

A disinfectant stand that passively sterilises its surrounding. Adds cleanliness and a little beauty. Great for makeshift hospital, addition to food area or bathroom (if you are using dubs hygiene.)

Requires Medicine Production and Sterile materials research. Can link to beds to boost immunity gain by 0.03%. Cost 1 component, 40 silver, 4 medicine, and 40 material of choice.

Medical Mats

Bedrolls used in the field or as caravan itinerary. Four tech versions (Medieval, Industrial, Spacer and Ultra) which can be researched after hospital beds (except for Medieval which is after Carpet Making). Note the items are best made in advance at a tailoring bench/crafting spot. Upon deconstruction it will return the base item used and using a crafting spot you can repack any uninstalled buildings to be rolled back up. Suggest using the mod "Pick up and haul".

Precursor Chemicals

MS uses a number of additional precursors in the generation of the drugs. This is to add game play value and additional balancing elements for the use of the drugs. Details can be found in the Drug reference PDF below.

Drugs

Details of the drugs can now be found in the following PDF:

MS Drugs Reference
https://1drv.ms/b/s!Au3GsmKyQkDYisxT3HAGCDQQd-g5Tw?e=8G5pCW


Immunisation

An immunisation injection can be made after Rimoxicillin research. Made from Ethyl mercury, Neutroamine and Rimoxicillin with the use of an industrial Med kit. The immunisation will either remove the “Sickly” trait from a colonist or will add the “Super-Immune” trait instead. It is provided in the form of a self-administered injection.

Cerebrax injection

Cerebrax is an injection that removes “negative” psychic sensitivity traits. Being spacer tech it is made with Ultratech medicine, Neutroamine, Lithium Salts and Clarity. The injection will remove psychic susceptibility traits in stages, so hyper-sensitivity will require two injections.


Additional Surgical procedures:

Medical Stent: Can be used to remove arterial blockages.

Artificial back discs: Can be used to remove the bad back condition.

Advanced Surgical tools: Can be used to perform complex surgeries where additional precision tools are required. Currently used in the following:

• Removal of Cataracts. (Combined with contact lenses).

Battle Stims

Battles Stims are short term Mechanite boosters akin to Luciferium, but the negative effects are different and more controlled in that there isn’t any lethality or addiction issues. Applied by self-administered injection prior to being drafted. The Stim lasts for half a day. (Further details in the PDF).

Transcendence

Transcendence is a stim that is similar to the Mechanoid Neurotrainer, it is an injection of treated mechanites that will effect the neural arrangements and chemistry of the brain. The effects of transcendence are less random with the capability of ordering the applied qualities of knowledge and skills learned into more characteristic skill sets. However the amount gained is slightly less than that of a normal Neurotrainer. (Further details in the PDF).


Mod Notes

Mod option to make bandage use more realistic.

Mod option to adjust the % base cost of research projects.

Includes bulk recipes as relevant. Includes bulk MS recipes for medicine and penoxy.

Also includes MS recipes for Ultratech Medicine, Healer mech serum and Ressurector mech serum as ultra tech. (Note that the Mech serums will need a number of Metasis vials to make).

Includes 3 different bandages at differing tech levels that act as a weaker counterpart to vanilla medicine but have advantages with weight, so ideal for caravan use or when medicine is limited.

Save compatible (Note: You will need to reassign new drug policies if part way through a savegame to schedule the use of the above MS drugs, see Drug Policy Fix below).

To remove the mod you would have to remove all the items introduced first.

    <name>[JPT] Soft Warm Beds HSK</name>
    <description>
Have you ever wondered why is it that we just need stone blocks or steel to build a bed, while wool and fur pile up on the warehouse, unused? Do you get a feeling it would be way more comfortable to lay down on something soft? And what if that cozy bed could also help with the freezing cold? Well, that's what this mod is all about!
Now your beds will only provide full comfort if you add some mattress, pillows and a blanket - or a bedding set, to simplify - which can be made at your regular tailor bench or crafting spot. More than that: depending on what these are made of, your beds can get even more comfortable than the regular ones, affecting their effectiveness in providing rest as well. Also, the material insulation properties carries over to the bed, helping keep your pawns warm.
But blankets, of course, can't help with the heat. For those playing on tropical climates, we included a tropical alternative to beds: hammocks! How come nobody thought of that before? These cheap hanging rigs may not be as comfortable as a full bed, but they do help cooling off. And being cheap and light, they can also be used as travel beds, just like bedrolls!

Overhauls weapons, artillery, apparel, and armor, up until Industrial Tech.		
Please let me know if you find bugs or have feedback!

CHANGE LOG 4.7 - January 22, 2022 - Retextured cheval de frise and added "Sudes" which are components used to build cheval de frise, but more importantly Ancient Roman-style stake walls and hadgehog defenses. They are essentally modular and be broken down without losing their parts so they can be rebuild elsewhere. You'll start with several sudes with the new Legionary scenario, as well as several tents to build your marching camp. Sudes are made from logs at the woodcutting bench.

CHANGE LOG 4.6 - January 16, 2022 - Added new Legion scenario.

CHANGE LOG 4.5 - September 6, 2021
	-Updated for 3.1 - Because 3.1 renders pawns differently, apparel texures now look like butt if you're zoomed in too much. I recommend setting zoom no lower than 3% in Camera+ settings for now.
	-Added new research prerequisites so you can't breeze through musket techs.
	-Updated some recipe names to include quantity
CHANGE LOG 4.4 - July 5, 2021
	-Updated for the research overhaul. 
	-Added neolithic wicker "pack basket" apparel, and the medieval backpack is called "rucksack" and uses the tribal backpack texture.
	-Retextured the blazer and renamed it "dinner jacket", which is now available in industrial tech. Wear it over a nice shirt. 	
	-Renamed the ammo for the arbalest MkII "quarrels" to avoid confusion with the light crossbow bolts, and rebalanced said ammo with a broadhead quarrel for hunting and a bodkin-head quarrel for armor piercing, and removed poison ammo (which is still available for light crossbows)	
	-New hand mending workbench added for repairing pre-industrial apparel and melee weapons.
	-Fixed poncho texture.
	-Nerfed Tsar Cannon shots slightly to decrease chances of friendly fire. Increased loading time, decreased aiming time.
		
CHANGE LOG 4.2 - May 31, 2021	
	-Fixed bug where some blueprints weren't shoing up.		
	-Recipe changes and other fixes
		
CHANGE LOG Quickfix 4.1 - April 20, 2021		
	-Work Tunic was onSkin layer - was supposed to be middle. You might get an apparel layer error when loading a save, but other than that, shouldn't be a problem. CannonParts texture path fixed. Deleted some unnecessary files.
CHANGE LOG Update 4.0 - April 19, 2021
	-Lots of broken and unbalanced recipes fixed (straw cape is now made of straw, Scutum shield is now actually buildable etc)
	-Recipes are moved around to different workbenches now. Most black powder weapons, ammunition and crates are made at the assembly table. Melee weapons and armor are still at the smithy and tailoring benches.	
	-Cannon crates now require the new "cannon component" as an ingredient
	-Gunpowder is required instead of FSX for ammo. Realized the vanilla hsk recipe is actually for "black powder" gunpowder, so I'll be adding nitrocellulose later on for modern ammo recipes.
	-You can make gunpowder at the *MILLING STONE* now.	
	-Grapeshot ammo can be made at stonecutting tables.
	-Research requirements for many guns and cannons. Smithing, Throwing Weapons, and Technology are the important ones.
	-The new Metallurgy update is coming soon. Just waiting on some incoming core HSK changes, and that will completely overhaul steelmaking as well as adding a new casting mechanic.	
		
CHANGE LOG Update 3.2 - March 16, 2021 - Oops, fixed ammo recipes so you can make them at the smithy.
CHANGE LOG Update 3.1 - Raised pistolet price so tribes will stop spawning with them.
CHANGE LOG Update 3 - apparel update
	-Patches some pawnkinds defs so now raider factions and starting neolithic colonists will wear clothes and armor that makes sense.
	-Updated apparel tags, for better searching
	-Added New categories and apparel sets for outfit-making.
	
	Again, save games still work, though you may see some weird stuff, for instance you might have a pawn wearing a piece of clothing with higher HP than its max HP, but I don't believe this will cause any problems.	
		
CHANGE LOG  Update 2
		
	NeoLithic Era / Bronze age:
	-Armors and apparel overhaul: Wicker and wood slat armor, straw cape, hide coat, bronze helm etc. 
	-Bows reimagined: Easy-to use flat blow and more advanced longbow.
		
	Medieval Era:
	-Reimagined apparel (many new textures, some are just cleaned-up and lightened for now)
	-Third bow type is the recurve bow, which is only effective in the hands of experts. 
	-Three crowssbows include the Light Crossbow, the slow, heavy Arbalest, and the inaccurate Nu Gong repeating crossbow. -
	-Crossbows are easy to use for unskilled fighters, but shorter range than a recurve or longbow. 
	-New Light Crossbow Bolts for the light crossbow and Nu Gong. Metallic and poison only.
	-Tsar Cannon: immobile giant bombard artillery which launches stone grapeshot over a wide area.
	-New Scutum shield	
		
	Early Modern Era
	-Black Powder muskets: Brown Bess, Charleville M1777, Jezail sniper musket, Pistolet. Easy-to-use and extremely deadly, but very inaccurate and slow-loading.
	-Round shot and buck shot in .69-in
	-Turret: 38mm swivel gun, available with grapeshot and round shot. 
	-New cannon/gun sounds
	-Some muskets come equipped with bayonets which turn them into formidable melee weapons	
	
	Industrial Revolution era
	-Black Powder Rifles: Springfield M1861, Sharps Carbine, Winchester 1866 lever-action, Colt Peacemaker
	-Turret: Gatling Gun
	-Field Cannon: 3-in Ordinance Rifle (with shotgun-like canister shot, and explosive shells)
	-Siege Cannon: 200-Pounder (with explosive shells and Greek Fire incendiary shells)
	-New cannon/gun sounds
		
	-New weapons and armors have detailed descriptions on how they're best used.	
		
	PLANS FOR NEXT UPDATE
	-Foundary building for casting tools, components, and cannon barrels, Bloomery building for producing cast iron and wrought iron, Possibly a water-powered trip hammer for producing weapons and tools.	
	-New production building for producing black powder firearms
	-New black powder ingredient.	
				
	KNOWN ISSUES / BUGS
	-Currently most of this exists in the medieval tech era, which makes everything avaialable all at once.
	-I have not yet updated the pawnkinds defs which means you may see a neolith NPC wearing a medieval sallet or something weird like that.
	-Save games should work, but you may suddenly have pawns wearing weird clothes/armor.
	-There may be balance issues, or random bugs. Please report any feedback to me! Thx!

CHANGE LOG  Update 1

	-Retextured every single armor.
	-Some textures are masked, mainly plate armors, so they can have material colors without looking dull. 
	-Bonuses/Penalties are more what you would expect
	-Better balanced – no more useless armors
	-Armor stats are more diverse - each one has something it's good at which is noted in descriptions.
	-Layer system streamlined with more options (eg. Gambeson + Hauberk + Plate), but there are still two-layer armors.
	-New Mail Coif which can be worn under most helmets and matches chainmail hauberk.
	-Armors more realistic / historically accurate
	-Defs listed in organized order so recipes are grouped together nicely in production buildings
	-New Pavise shield, which is a portable stationary defense for archers/crossbowmen to carry with them.

	-New thematic armors that can mix-and-match or work as sets: 
		-Horde (warlord) armors have a Golden Horde / Genghis Khan feel.
		-Legion armors in a Roman legionnary style
		-Tatami+Kabuto Samurai-style armor
		-Rennaisance style set which fare a bit better against firearms.
		-Feral Plate armors now have post-apocalyptic / Mad Max sorta feel

	NOTES / ROADMAP / DISCLAIMERS
	-You may get "duplicate def" errors, but it should without problems work nonetheless. If you want to remove the errors, delete (and backup) the CoreSK / Defs / ThingDefs_Apparel folder. 	

	-This is essentially in alpha, but should be fairly balanced. All armors have been tested to fit the colonists, but I haven't tested every combination. Please let me know if you find that some armor setups look awkward.		

	-All armors are craftable, so HMC-AllArmorsCraftable shoudln't be needed.

	-Mail Coif uses a CombatExtended body layer that only shows up in list view, which is pointed out in the item's description. So go to list view in the gear tab to unequip. I'm not sure how to fix that mod or if it's an easy fix.

	-Will be redoing a few non-armor apparel items and primitive items, but that is “Part Two”, which I'm working on now. Also planning to retexture some Royalty apparel in the future. Planning a small weapons retexture and also add matchlock guns in a later update to go with the Renaissance armors. 

	-Disclaimer: This is hardcore, so some recipes are slightly more complex. Many use metal components or patch leather. Feral armors use things from salvaged wrecks.

	-Still need to retexture shields. Pavise needs north/east textures added. Will be in next update.

	-Masks add considerably more PNG files (probably less than 1 MB). 

	-May need translation help once this comes out of alpha.

    <name>VileRequisite-Fences And Floors by HSK</name>
    <description>
This mod adds 4 new styles of flooring and 4 fences (3 perimeter fences and a smaller defensive barrier). Fences are gathered into their own menu category and research requirements have been applied where appropriate. Plywood paneling and the simple wood fence are available from the beginning and are relatively simple to construct. Upon completing the Machining research requirement access to chainlink fencing, high security fencing, the security barrier, steel grate flooring, and metal panel flooring is made available. The last addition, sensor panel flooring, becomes constructable upon completing a new research project: "Reactive Flooring."

Some additions exhibit special qualities. Steel grating has an inherent bonus to cleanliness due to most dust and detritus falling cleanly through the grate. Wood and chainlink fences can be fired through while providing a small amount of cover. The security barrier can be walked over (though with some difficulty), much like vanilla sandbags, but still provide good cover from incoming fire. Lastly, sensor panels include advanced electronics, sensors, and networking components within their design. They are expensive and difficult to construct but react to the presence of pedestrians moving overhead by optimizing their surface to the users stride resulting in a more pleasant walk.

Viles notes:
Wood fence overwrites the new vanilla fence. Also changed some values here and there to work with my other mods.</description>

SeasonalWeather
Extends weather to change based on season. Please comment and let me know any feedback about seasonal settings or potential related features.

Features
Each season has different weather commonalities for each weather type
All biomes have weather adapted a bit to fit each season. More to come.
Most biomes are less clear now and I think Jungles in particular will go more in this direction.
New weather types are added: Dust, Dry Duststorm, Foggy Snow, Cloudy, and Windy
New weather disasters are added: Wildfire, and Earthquake
Disasters can be disabled/enabled in mod settings
Growth rates are increased for plants by 20% during rainfall
Weather Drone has been added (maybe needs a better name). Weather can affect mood in rare cases (like a psychic drone).
Added Double Rainbow. Rarely after a weather event which contained rain, a double rainbow appears and improves moods.
Wildfires
Intvention will shorten the length of this event
Min length if fire is surpressed is about half a day
Min length without intervention is 5 days
Max length a quadrum
Translations
English
Turkish (by Slevilex)
Acknowledgements

    <description>Vile's Armory reworks, retextures, and rebalances firearms for Hardcore SK. It uses all the textures I created for Weapon Modularization, but is an alternative to that mod, for those of us who want better guns, but not the excessive options.

As with most of my mods, it's my thinking that every available option (be they guns, apparel, materials, etc) does something that the other options don't and that they are unique and distinct. And so it is with this mod as well. Each gun has listed in its description what its pros and cons are to make decisions easier. 

This also utilizes Vile's Materials Science, to make better use of the variety of materials. For instance, lighter guns may require a light material such as aluminum or nylon. Much of this is based on real-life construction too, just for fun.

This mod is still in the early stages and there may be some typos and balancing that will need to be worked out. The spacer guns are still a WIP as well, and I may add some very minor "modularization" of my own, if I feel there are some places where certain gun qualities are missing.

    <description>Version 0.13A - 1/25/2022 - Seasonal Weather mod doesn't seem to be working, so please disable it (If removing Seasonal Weather breaks your savegame, re-enable seasonal weather but delete everything in VP_SK_Seasonal Weather/Patches/). Patching/adjusting biome base weathers to compensate, but likely will need some balance adjustment as we test it. Savanna will alternate a lot between month-long monsoon rains and droughts. Added harvestable caribou moss and bearberries from the Tundra to make it more playable. Adjusted grow-rate of grasses for cold biomes and moved some around a bit. More balance tweaks here and there and more to come.

Version 0.12A - 1/19/2022 - Remixed boreal a bit, added back in missing water terraforms, fixed yet another framerate issue (should be final this time). Keep the feedback comin'!
Version 0.11A - 1/18/2022 - fixed issue affecting framerate during cold weather, missing textures, improves some textures.
Version 0.1A - 1/17/2022
	
Dislaimer: This is a brand new mod, which means it needs some testing. By reading this, you agree to offer your soil in exchange for early access to this mod. That is to say, please send me feedback on discord if anything seems weird or buggy, or if something just looks off. And before you ask, yes, you'll have to start a new game, or at least move your colony to a new tile so the biome can regenerate. I also recommend using the patched Seasonal Weather mod with this.

Thank you everyone for the continued feedback. Special thanks to Sidfu, Pautinich, and Kamil for their patronage :Raises Wineglass of Bog Water:

Biomes: From The Groud Up overhauls biomes... from the ground up. Here's the dirt:
	
1. Retextures nearly every plant and tree and adds many new ones. Some are harvestable, some are purely aesthetic.
2. Repopulates biomes to be more realistic, but more importantly, more distinct from one another.	
3. Retextures (moved from Hardcore Renovation) and revises terrains, and adds several new ones to further give the biomes more distinction.
4. Terrain generation is revised to form more unique landmasses in some biomes.
5. Trees more likely to grow in groves (moved from Wood You Please).
6. Terraforming revised to be (hopefully) more streamlined - it's a balancing work in progress.
7. Scatterables removed from ice and sand (those ugly blotches that are always there)
8. Adds a few new foods to go with the new plants (bog cranberries, wetland cattails, desert prickly pears, and brought back blueberries which grow in taiga and boreal)
9. Biomes have seasonal weather (requires supporting mod), some have wet and dry seasons, wildfire seaons, hurricane seasons, etc. 	
	
Now for what's new and different:

___SOILS!___
New and revised soils are based off of US Soil Taxonomy (which isn't really important unless you're a nerd). They're listed in order of fertility:

Rich Soil - Alluvium - typically only found around ponds and in small patches.
Grassland Soil - Mollisol - Found in the savanna.
Fertile Soil - Alfisol - Found in termperate forests, equivalent of vanilla "soil"
Volcanic Soil - Andisol - Currently only found in small patches in rainforests, but can be terraformed with ash.
Red Clay Soil - Ultisol - Found in rainforests. It turns out rainforests don't have great soil.
Marshy Soil - Mineral Hydric Soil - Found in wetlands
Leached Soil - Oxisol - Found in rainforests.
Mossy Soil - Spododsol - Found is boreal forests and tundra in smaller amounts.
Arid Soil - Aridisol - Found in deserts.
Muck - Sapric Histosol - Found in Tropical Swamps. Contains moderate amounds of peat and organic matter.
Cracked Clay - Vertisol - Found in deserts. Nutrients and be extracted via terraforming.
Weak Soil - Inseptisol - Young soils found in boreak forests.
Mucky Peat - Hemist Histosol - Found in temperate swamps. Contains a fair amount of peat and some organic matter.
Turbulent Soil - Gelisol (Turbels) - Rocky tundra soil. 
Peat Soil - Fabrist Histosol - Found in Bogs. Contains high amounts of peat.
Undeveloped Soil - Entisol - Found near rock forms and gravel.
Coarse Sand - Found in beaches and deserts with barely any nutrient value.
Desert Sand - Dune sand found in extreme deserts. Nothing can grow here and it's hard to walk on.
Gravel - Relatively unchanged apart from new texture.
Desert Pavement - A strange formation sometimes found in deserts.
Bog Water - Highly acidic water found in bogs.
Swamp Water - Found in temperate swamps.
Black Water - Found in tropical swamps.
Ice - Good ol' ice. 
Clear Ice - Smooth ice which is very hard to traverse.
Frozen Snow - Easier to walk on than ice.

___NEW PLANTS!___
There are lots of new plants. Here are a few:

TREES and SHRUBS:
Kapok Tree: Gigantic trees found in the rainforest (experimental two-layer texture).
Spruce Tree: Found in bogs and cold regions.
Acacia Tree: Found in savannas and deserts.
Juniper: Coniferous shrub found in colder regions.

EDIBLE:
Blueberry.
Cranberries: Only found in bogs.
Prickly pear: Found in savannas and deserts.
Cattail: Found in wetlands.

GRASSES and MOSSES:
Sedge
Rush
Swampgrass (grows in water)
Lawn Grass
Peat Moss: Can be harvested for fertilizer
Bearberry: Decorative tundra groundcover
Caribou Moss

___NOTES___

Cattail and swampgrass currently have this thing where they appear in places they should when you first generate the map, but will disappear immediately. It shouldn't affect gameplay.

Some pretty drastic changes were made to some of the biome generation. It's impossible for me to test every possible iteration, so please send feedback if you find anything weird.

VILE'S HELL BENT FOR LEATHER Tanning 
V.0.3
AUG.16.2022
=====================================

Hell Bent for Leather Tanning is another supplement to Vile's overhaul system which adds, uhhhh, leather tanning. 

This is currently in early alpha, and I have very limited time for testing so I'm humbly relying on help for feedback and bug reports. So, um, take that as both a disclaimer and a plead. I will try to make updates daily. Thanks in advance!

Some feedback I would appreciate:
	- Missing/wrong textures (note that the leather colors will likelye change)
	- Missing or broken recipes
	- Balance issues with recipes and materials
	- Elements that just don't seem "fun"
	- Content you want to see
	- Any other bugs or things that don't seem right
	
Notes for fellow modders and patchers at the end of this doc!

=====================================
QUICK GUIDE / WHAT'S NEW
=====================================

Hides and Skins: When you butcher an animal, you now get hides, skins and furs instead of leather. This makes the production chain more challenging, but it also gives you options and new materials and colors to play with. 

Once you get going, you'll have a choice once you're ready to tan your hides. You can produce full-grain leathers, which uses the entire thickness, showing the true grain of the skin. It's the superior option. Because blemishes of the hide's surface must be cut off, there is wasted product in the form of strips, which can later be made into poor-quality bonded leather. Your other option is to split the hide. This will give you an unfinished "top-grain" leather where the blemishes are sanded off so you get more leather for your dollar. That's not all - you also get the split leather, or the flesh-side of the leather. This is suede. It kinda sucks but it breathes nicely and can made into "genuine leather". The top-grains leathers can also be dyed and processed into embossed finished leather, nubuck, and upholstry leather. There are also ways to produce ultra-grade leathers using products harvested from Feenix, Kirins, Thrumbos and similar animals.

ROTTING AND CURING: Raw skins and hides will eventually rot unless you cure them or freeze them. There are two ways to cure hides:

- Drying Rack: Small skins can be air dried, but thicker hides must be cured with salt or ash. Takes over a day.

- Brining Station: Soak skins and	 hides in brine. Uses salt as fuel, and can be done quiclkly be a colonist.

- Freezing: Just throw it in a freezer.

LEATHER TANNING: Hides and skins must be tanned to become useable leather.

- Brain Tanning: A traditional method using animal innards and smoking at a campfire. Produces only buckskin. Neolithic Tech.

- Vegetable Tanning: A method that uses tannins from tree bark to tan the hide. Can take over a day.

- tree bark is now produced when cutting wood.

- Chrome Tanning: A method of tanning that uses chromium. Fast and done in large batches, but long exposure to the tanning drum can cause serious heath effects.

=====================================
LLEATHER GRADES (and their bet uses)
=====================================
FULL-GRAIN LEATHER - Premium leather. Uses the whole hide, with wasted strips leftover.
	Breathable Leather 
	Exotic Leather
	Heavy Leather 
	Durable Leather	
	Stock Leather	
	Light Leather
	Soft Leather
	Sterile Leather
	Warm Fur
	Rugged Fur
	Heavy Fur
	Fine Fur
	
TOP-GRAIN LEATHERS - Instead of using the full grain, the leather can be split. The top part can be processed later into more useful leathers and dyed various colors.
	Unfinished Leather	
	Finished Leather
	Nubuck
	Upholstry Leather
	
SPLIT LEATHERS et al - The flesh side of the split. Not as good quality as the top grain.
	Suede 
	Genuine Leather
	Bonded Leather(made from leftover leather strips)
	
ULTRA-GRADE LEATHER - Large beasts like Feenix and Thrumbo drop resources when butchered that can be mixed with leathers to produce superior leathers.
	Ventan Leather (compare to Feenix Leather)
	Thermatan Leather (compare to Kirin leather)
	Armatan Leather (best for armor)
	Hygieiatan Leather (best for hospitals)
	
Hard Leather Materials: New and revised materials that can be used in place of metal in certain armor recipes and clothing.
	Rawhide
	Cuir Bouilli (aka boiled leather)
	Chitin
	Dragon Scales (from wyvern, kirin, feenix)

=====================================
MODDING / PATCHING NOTES:
=====================================
Hide defs are new, most leather defs are patched from existing defs. So if you add another mod which adds new pawns, you will need to change the "leatherType" to one of the new hide defs. Furthermore, you'll want to reduce the "leatherAmount" by 1/5th since tanning multiplies the ingredients by 5-ish.

    <description>Version 0.1
This is the final major part of the Vile's series of overhaul mods for Hardcore SK. It finishes what Metallurgy and Pre-Industrial Overhaul started, namely, adding realism, complixity, and streamlines and rebalances materials while making it a bit more intuitive. Unlike Metallurgy though, it doesn't add a lot more steps in the production chain. Here's a rundown of the overhaul:
        
    CHANGES and ADDITIONS:
    - New Ore Refining system. "Iron Ore", "Tin Ore" replaced with "Magnetite" and "Cassiterite" etc. These are refined to their base elements at the Metal Extraction Plant. Inspired by Angel's Factorio mod.
        - With improved techology and the Electrolytic Refinery, more and new base metals can be extracted from the ores at the expense of work speed and electrical power.
    - Labels and descriptions are improved to make finding materials and knowing which ones to use easier.
    - Most materials revised, with many added ones, including alloys, plastics, textiles, etc.
    - A revised materials tier system: Tiers are divided by tech level, but each material within each tier does something it excels at over the others. Suggested uses are easily laid out in the descriptions.
    - Revised recipes for items and buildings, to utilize the new materials and add realism.
    - Rimefeller overhaul, with an expanded polymer industry. 
        - Petrochemical byproducts include ethylene, benzene, petroleum coke, etc. 
        - Instead of only "plastic" you have PVC, polycarbonate, fiberglass, aerographene, and more.
    - A few intermediate materials are replaced with things that make more sense. No more "compound paste" and "paraffins". Now we have "epoxy resin" and "teflon".
    - Added a new "chemistry station" for new chemicals such as lye, chlorine, etc.
    - Plant wax replaces paraffins as a fuel for candles.
    - Coin minting added. Refining galena ore gives you "pure silver".
    - IMPORTANT! The electrylytic refinery must be linked (near) to the metal extraction plant to refine ores, and the chemistry station must be linked to the loom to make advanced textiles. Note that these recipes don't appear in the wikirim. Looking into it.
    - And of course, tons of new and revised textures.

    ROADMAP:
    - Cool spreasheets and stuff because those are fun.
    - Nucleosynthesis Converter recipes.
    - Make stuff masks for some MS building textures.
    - Add 2 new concrete types.
    - Update mineral/rock textures.
    - Insulation Support for Celcius mod.
    - New refinery building textures.
    - Integrate new glass types with Windows.
    - Revamp late-game power generation. Perhaps add geothermal drilling.
    - Rimatomics defense materials.
    - Various buildings and recipes as I come across them, or are brought to my attention.
    - HSK currently doens't work well with the “heat” damage type. This will improve as we go into 1.4.
    
    Many of my other mods are updated to work with this, so make sure to get the latest of those.

Update A0.3
-Updated for 1.3
-Lead smelting now produces 15 instead of 10. Quick fix until the upcoming Ores and Minerals update. For now, set up a mining camp if your map lacks lead.
-Added mod dependencies. Consider using Realistic Terraforming to get peat, clay, etc quicker. I've not tested this without it.
-Making Rimatomics a dependancy. There's an assembly in there that allows the water wheel to use any large water body, not just rivers.
-Fixed some typos etc.
	
INTRODUCTION	
This could also be called 'Pre-Industrial Part II: Metallurgical Overhaul'. It's part of an ongoing project of mine to add some more complex mechanics to HSK that are both realistic and historically accurate, but in a manner that makes it fun, immersive, and hopefully intuitive.

That said, this is the first part of a materials overhaul, with focus on early-game metallurgy and steel-making. Below is a quick summary of how it works. There is more detailed information in the descriptions of the buildings and resources, and a wiki/guide is underway.
	
NEOLITHIC
A new fire pit is added which separates non-food recipes from the campfire, and adds a few more, mainly for dealing with smelting metals of antiquity such as bronze and silver.
	
CERAMIC KILN
The kiln now acts like the fermenter buildings in that you load it with stuff, and then wait several days or hours instead of standing there watching it. It's in the "processing" submenu and you'll make things such as:
		Bricks
		Charcoal
		Coke (metallurgical coal that is further processed)
		Flux powder (used in ceramics and metallurgy)
		Wootz Steel
		Clay pots
	
WOOTZ STEEL
Commonly referred to as "Damascus Steel" because a lot of wootz steel was imported to Damascus, it's a fragile, but ultra-hard steel best used for cutlery and sharp weapons.

POTTERY STATION
There is a new pottery station for making clay pots for food storage. They can be glazed with a variety of materals to increase beauty and make it seal better for improved food preservation. Vanilla pots can still be made out of metal, but they're more expensive and inferior to glazed pottery. Clay pots must be fired in the kiln, and then used as an ingredient much like how a crate is used to make a turret.

BLOOMERY and WROUGHT IRON / FORGED STEEL
The earlist technology for smelting iron. Ore is smelted into an "iron bloom", which then must be hammered into wrought iron at smithy forge (or finery forge). It's a long process with low payout, but you'll eventually run out of tin or copper for producing bronze so you'll want to start making wrought iron. Like you learned in history class. The wrought iron can further be carburized into weld-forged steel, your first type of proper steel. Contrary to popular belief, however, wrought iron can still be used to make effective weapons and armor — in this mod it is considered that these wrought iron implements are "case hardened", or tempered to strengthen the outer surface of the iron into a thin layer of steel.

BOG IRON from PEAT
Small pellets of iron can often be found in peat bogs. You can extract bog iron from peat at machining tables for a never-ending supply of iron. Mining is still the most efficient way to getting it though.

BLAST FURNACE AND PIG IRON
The blast furnace replaces the vanilla furnace. It makes iron ore into pig iron instead (a crude high-carbon form of iron which is worthless on its own). The pig must be processed at a finery into wrought iron and is much faster and more efficient than processing bloom. Pig iron can also be refined into cast iron at a foundry.

FINERY FORGE / WATER WHEEL
The finery forge is like a smithy forge except it has a heavy mechanical trip-hammer required for smashing the carbon out of pig iron to turn it into wrought iron (or welded steel). It can be operated by hand, but it's best powered by a water wheel. It's smart to build by a FLOWING RIVER if you can, otherwise you may want to rush the foundry and puddling tech.

STAMP MILL / WATER WHEEL
Another way to take advantage of the water wheel is with the stamp mill. It can be used for smashing grain, but also making gunpowder and crushing stone into rubble or sand.

FOUNDRY, CASTING
The foundry is dual purpose: It can be used for casting, which is a method of producing items quickly and in large batches. It's limited to certain types of tools, components and ammunition, and the castable metals are also very limited. It can also be used for processing certain metals and alloys, notably cast iron, and turning pig iron into wrought iron through what is called "puddling" - a method which is much more efficient than through the finery. It can also be used to produce crucible steel. More on that next.

CEMENTATION FURNACE and BLISTER STEEL / CRUCIBLE STEEL
This building works much like the kiln. Fill it with wrought iron and a source of carbon and wait several days. The iron becomes what's known as "blister steel", which is not homogenous and is useless on its own. It can be processed at a smithy or finery to produce "sheer steel", which resembles forge-welded steel, and for purposes of simplification, we'll just call it that. The ultimate, purest form of steel produced before the second industrial revolution, however is *Crucible Steel*. This is made by simply melting down the blister steel at the foundry once the tech is unlocked. It requires both coke and flux. 

STEAM ENGINE
The blowing engine is an automated bellows which speeds up the blast furnace and foundry operation.

PIPES
Water pipes are now divided into two types: aqueducts and, well, pipes. The former are made like how you're used to making them, and the latter require "plumbing components", which can be made at a forge or cast at the foundry. They're much stronger and easier to install.

WEAPONS AND TOOLS
A new CHEF KNIFE is added. Unlike the dagger and regular knife, the material used to make them can imply further bonuses. The *ULFBERT* and RIMASCUS SCIMITAR are two new swords that require wootz steel to make. An armor-piercing LUCERNE HAMMER replaces the royalty warhammer, and the royalty axe is removed and replaced with a QUARTERSTAFF, which is good for takedowns and less-lethal stick fighting.
		
Previous Updates: 

A0.2
-Removed grain recipes from stamp mill, fixed it so it's craft-worker based.
-Patched cleaver, dagger, and knife to work as survival tools. The latter is renamed "survival knife" and may instill bonuses to construction and smithing. There's no penalty for not using a knife for cooking, and if the bonusus will only take affect if over 100%. Late-game alloys have cooking bonuses of 100%... updating that is on the road map.
-Fixed some textures
-Improved labels for processing recipes</description>

Adds three biomes: 
Prairie (a temperate grassland)
Montane Forest (a boreal forest variation, less dense, may contain lakes)
Montane Birch Grasslands (a cold grassland)
Adds back Cloudberries, and a new flower, bluebells.


Uses Odeum's Biomes Kit (details below) 

BiomesKit is a framework for the placement of biomes on the world map at worldgen. Previously, modders needed to utilize C# to add new biomes to rimworld. With BiomesKit, placement of a biome can be controlled with XML tags in the BiomeDef itself.

With BiomesKit as a dependency, you too can make your own biomes mod with minimal hassle! Features of BiomesKit includes but are not limited to:
* Spawning biomes based on factors like elevation, rainfall, hilliness and more!
* Restricting your biome to spawn only on specific vanilla biomes, or even biomes from other mods!
* Changing the hilliness of a tile to a specific level, or even randomizing it!
* Custom world map tile graphics for your biome!

Update 1.2 - 1/20/2020 - Added acacia wood.  
Update 1.1: No major changes, but the new mod Biomes: From The Ground Up, is meant to pair well with this mod.	  
	  
HEY! You want some planks? Planks come from trees. There's lots of different kinds of trees. Planks can be made into all sorts of cool things. Can you? Didn't think so. This is hardcore SK. It's hardcore, like the heartwood of a tree. Show these trees the respect they deserve. Now stop complaining and drink your maple syrup.

Version A0.1  
This is super flipping early alpha. It's a huge overhaul of logs and planks, so I'm not entirely sure how it will affect all other parts of the game or other mods yet. If anything seems weird, recipes broken, etc, please let me know on the HSK Discord.

What does this mod change?
Logs and planks are unique to their tree species and have color and specs rebalanced for realism and a more distinctive gameplay based on biome. 
I highly recommend using this with the my new Hardcore Renovations mod which fully takes advantage of these new wood types in floors and walls.

Basic info:  

Felled trees now produce larger, but fewer logs (with Bamboo as the exception. It's not a tree anyway.), and can't be used as fuel except in advanced furnaces (TBD). A new woodsplitting spot (much like the butcher spot) allows colonists to split the logs into firewood which can be used for crafting redimentary things like arrows, clapboard floors and walls, as fuel, or can be further split into kindling for fueling torches, etc.

I. Wood is now divided into three categories (in order of the janka scale of hardness):

Softwoods:
	  Cecropia
	  Pine
	  Willow
	  Redwood
	  Cypress
	  Poplar
Hardwoods:
	  Maple
	  Teak
	  Birch
	  Oak
      Acacia
	  Bamboo
Ultra-hard:
	  Drago
	  Mangrove

Softer woods tend to offer less HP, but are often easier to work with and the trees are easier to cut. Technically, some of the softwoods are actually hardwoods, but I'm basing this off their actual hardness, not official designations.
Harder woods also produce more firewood since they can be chopped into smaller pieces.  
	  
II. Tree generation has changed.
	  1. Growing time and harvest amount has been adjusted for realism and balance. 
	  2. Most trees are now more likely to grow in groves. This means if you want to harvest a particular type of wood, you can target specific parts of the map to do so. Use the magnifying glass feature on the minimap or the Object Seeker to help find the groves.	  

III. New Woodsplitting Spot is an ingredientless building for splitting logs into firewood and kindling early game. Obviously slower than the workbench.

IV. Anywhere there was a vanilla wood log, there is now "firewood". Anywhere there was vanilla wood planks, there is now plywood. Plywood can be made out of scraps of logs or planks, much how patch leather is made. 
	  
Feedback is appreciated. Thanks!

Update Sept 26, 2021 - Lowered splitting spot workspeed, but also lowered recipe work. Also, you can now build the woodcutting table out of planks if you wish, for increased workspeed.

=====================================
VILE'S Work Tab for Big Fonts        
=====================================
This mod is a minor accessibility mod meant to make the microscopic work tab information easier to see. It is meant to work with the new Vile RimThemes.

- Changes the labels of jobs in the work tab, so instead of Craft: "Do Bills at Neolithic Craft" (which appears as "Do Bills at Ne..." in larger fonts), it's shortened to just "Neolithic".
- Work Types are now ALL CAPS so that they stand apart more from the work defs when you open the worktype to see the subjobs. 
- Some things are moved around. If you don't want that, delete the "reorganized" folder in Patches, and "WorkTypes.xml" in Defs. 

New WorkTypes:
MISC - This is mostly unusued junk. Stuff that may be required by other mods to exist, but typically aren't used in modded HSK.
PROCESSING - This is for mosly hauling jobs that are a bit more on the crafting side. Universal Fermenter jobs are moved here, which includes things like the drying rack, tanning vats, kiln, and cementation furnace.
BIOTECH HAULING - Simply moves some stuff out of hauling into a new work type.

Some other notable changes:
- Refill Water and Refuel Refuelable Buildings (now called "Refuel") are moved to the BASIC worktype.
- Neolithic Crafting is moved to the SMITHING worktype

This is a simple mod that adds new versions of existing apparel, currently just medieval. The stats are identical, but the names are slightly different, such as "bonnet" and "bonnet, brimmed", and the textures are alterled slightly for flavor.

"Why?" you ask. 

Simple. When I play I like to make color-coordinated loadouts. But there aren't enough apparel pieces to make that feasible, at least early game. So this way, I can dress my builders in orange leather tunics, and my farmers in green hemp tunics.

That's all.</description>

Осколочные ракеты - увеличено количество осколков.
Зажигательные ракеты - получили новую начинку из белого фосфора , горит долго и ярко.
Эми ракеты - кроме самого урона от Эми получили шоковую волну механоидов (нужны тесты - насколько теперь удобно жарить роботов )
Ракеты с антиматерией - Был кластер, и нет кластера механоидов(Из снаряжения осады исключил , чтоб у колонии были шансы)
4 вида ударных дрона
1 новый вид мин
1 пусковую установку
Обновление добавляет катапульту для БПЛА - более точный аналог Миномёта. Учтите что БПЛА крайне опасны. Позволяет вести огонь по соседним клеткам.

Добавлены патроны с белым фосфором для калибров:
14.5x114mm
20x102mm
30x173mm
.50BMG
90mm
120mm
155mm
130mm-Ракеты

ENG
This modification changes the 130mm rockets, the damage has been changed (increased), the textures have been changed, the craft has been changed. The ability to fire rockets at neighboring maps has been added (a 155mm cannon can, but not rockets?). For rockets, different damage has been prescribed for the enemy base.
Fragmentation rockets - the number of fragments has been increased.
Incendiary rockets - received a new filling of white phosphorus, burns long and brightly.
Amy missiles - in addition to the damage from Amy, they received a shock wave of mechanoids (tests are needed to see how convenient it is to fry robots now)
Antimatter missiles - There was a cluster, but there is no cluster of mechanoids (excluded from the siege equipment so that the colony had a chance)
4 types of attack drones
1 new type of mine
1 launcher
The update adds a catapult for UAVs - a more accurate analogue of the Mortar. Please note that UAVs are extremely dangerous. Allows you to fire at neighboring cells.

Eng
Added white phosphorus cartridges for calibration:
14.5x114 mm
20x102mm
30x173mm
.50BMG

		Si vis pacem, para bellum - If you want peace, prepare for war

+New Research and small compatibility patch with "Vile's Pre-Industrial" and "HSK More Content" mod

The mod adds weapon, ammo, explosives, turrets, and the new update add more of them, including new balance, new research, new patches for HSK More Content and Vile's Mod(Pre-Industrial to be exact)

Stuff to add combat variety and now included a chronological like progression research like how Vile did for Pre-Industrial, the mod focus on stuffs after Pre-Industrial  mostly, for now

Any issue report it to me or pin me in Discord Server or in my mod Thread, I pass most of my time in the English server, any suggestion, feedback and bug report is always welcome!(I really need those), thanks for using my mod

Sorry that I don't speak russian, also I am not a native English speaker, but I do speak English, Spanish and Chinese, so you are free to correct any typo I made and anyone is free to translate my mod to any other language if you want.

Moved the changelog to separated text file


[RUS - переводчик]

		  Теперь поддержка русского перевода благодаря г-ну Винни Пух 

		Si vis pacem, para bellum - Если хочешь мира, готовься к войне
		

+ Новое исследование и небольшой патч совместимости с модами "Vile's Pre-Industrial" и "HSK More Content"

Основной целью этого мода было добавить больше оружия для базового HSK, на данный момент

Мод добавляет оружие, боеприпасы, взрывчатку, турели, а новое обновление добавляет их больше, включая новый баланс, новые исследования, новые патчи для HSK More Content и Vile's Mod (точнее доиндустриальный)

Материал для добавления разнообразия боя и теперь включает в себя хронологическое исследование прогресса.

О любой проблеме сообщите мне или закрепите меня на сервере Discord или в моей ветке мода, я провожу большую часть своего времени на английском сервере, любые предложения, отзывы и отчеты об ошибках всегда приветствуются! (Мне они действительно нужны), спасибо за использование моего мода


Извините, мне трудно переводить журнал изменений, но я постараюсь предоставить его.

		Si vis pacem, para bellum - If you want peace, prepare for war

This is an extension of Parabellum Mod, the mod add any military hardware that I find fun/interesting to play with, can be something to explore CE limits or something that add challenge and variety for HSK combat.

[RUS - переводчик]

		Si vis Pacem, para bellum - Хочешь мира, готовься к войне

Это расширение мода Parabellum, мод добавляет любую военную технику, с которой мне весело/интересно играть, может быть чем-то, чтобы исследовать ограничения CE или что-то, что добавляет сложности и разнообразия в бою HSK.

Этот перевод не очень точен, извините
